# time-series-analysis-in-R

This is a simple, introductory series of codes used for common analysis of time series using R. 
In the end, we are building knowledge in order to build an ARIMA model, etc., for model forecasting. 

Please follow the links below to view the R notebooks (.Rmd) on my public [rpubs.com](http://rpubs.com/richkt) account (note that codes that are not complete yet do not have direct links attached, but I am working to get them uploaded ASAP). Otherwise, see the .Rmd files within this repository:

1. [Stationarity testing](http://rpubs.com/richkt/269797) 
2. [Change point detection](http://rpubs.com/richkt/269908) 
3. Simple Component Analysis
4. Decomposing (seasonality, trend, etc.)
4. ARIMA model
