# time-series-analysis-in-R

This is an simple, intorductory series of codes used for analysis of time series signals in R. 
The codes will be upload/updated as fast as I can get to them to generalize them for various applications. 
In the end, we are building knowledge in order to build an ARIMA model for forecasting, etc.
