# time-series-analysis-in-R

This is an simple, intorductory series of codes used for analysis of time series signals in R. 
The codes will be upload/updated as fast as I can get to them to generalize them for various applications. 
In the end, we are building knowledge in order to build an ARIMA model for forecasting, etc. 

Please follow the links below to view the R notebooks (.Rmd) on my public [rpubs.com](http://rpubs.com/richkt) account (note that the codes that are not complete yet do not have direct links attached, but I am working to get them uploaded). Otherwise see the .Rmd files within this repository:

1. [Stationarity testing](http://rpubs.com/richkt/269797) of time series signals
2. [Change point detection](http://rpubs.com/richkt/269908) in time series signals
3. Simple Component Analysis
4. Exponential smoothing
4. ARIMA model
